        When was London founded? London's founding can be traced to 43 CE, when
        the Roman armies began their occupation of Britain under Emperor
        Claudius. At a point just north of the marshy valley of the River
        Thames, where two low hills were sited, they established a settlement
        they called Londinium.

        Big Ben is arguably London’s most famous landmark. Surprisingly, it is
        actually meant to go by the name ‘The Clock Tower’, while ‘Big Ben’ is
        the name of the bell. Feel free to bore your friends and family with
        that fact if you ever do a tour of London.

        One of Christopher Wren’s original ideas for St Paul’s Cathedral
        proposed a 60 foot stone Pineapple in place of the now iconic dome. It’s
        a shame it didn’t happen, London’s skyline could have done with a
        tropical feel.

        The Great Fire in 1666 devastated London. While the fire reduced large
        parts of the city to ruins, the verified death toll was only six people.
        However, the real number is unknown, as many more died from indirect
        causes. Monument, the 203ft stone obelisk located 203 ft away from where
        the fire broke out, commemorates those who died.
